            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Educational methods include
                teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
                under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place
                in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.

                Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Programs at ISCED level 2, lower secondary education are usually
                organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. Teachers
                typically have pedagogical training in the specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a
                class of students will have several teachers, each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they
                teach. Programmes at ISCED level 2, aim to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human
                development upon introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be
                developed in future stages. Some education systems may offer vocational education programs during ISCED
                level 2 providing skills relevant to employment</p>
